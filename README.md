### Strings Sort:

After Too many emails asking about this I will say this here to prevent you lost your time,
My tool don't put the string in alphabetical order, this is the style of the PSB file format,

> And what you need/can do to restore the string order? 

The hard way is explore the PSB format and write a tool to recogite all bytecodes

> WTF, how?

Ehh okay, I'm publishing a sample to everyone see, isn't fully working because is just a sample see the PSBAnalyzer.cs > TryAnalyze Function and good lucky

> If you can why you don't create the tool fully?!

Because I created the tool to my own usage, and i don't need this feature.

> Wtf, how you can translate without this feature?

You Know about the AGTH/ITH?
Yes, it's possible use it to help, I implement a sample too,
just inject the AGTH/ITH and make he copy the dialog to the clipbard
with the KrKrScnGui with the atual script open...
